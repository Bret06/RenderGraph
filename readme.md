# Welcome to RenderGraph!
So you're probably wondering what this is at all, unless you're here from my YouTube channel in which case you know exactly what it is. RenderGraph is a Data-Driven JSON based editing software. It is also my first open source project, so feel free to make a PR with any changes you see fit! 

# Why make it?
I made RenderGraph because I hate editing videos and a lot of that hatred comes from the need to click through panels and windows to make a small thing happen. Let's be real, modern editing softwares while extremely versatile are extremely time consuming to use because of the immense amount of buttons, panels, etc. If you know me, you know I program solutions for things that are barely problems but this time I might've cooked. 

# How does it work?
RenderGraph is a simple NodeJS script that runs using [FFMPEG](https://www.ffmpeg.org). If you don't have it installed on your PC you will need it to run this. The layout of the command interface is extremely simple, just follow the prompts and you'll get the hang of it. I might document this more in the future unless some other kind soul comes along and beats me to it. xD
